Social Login Integration with ASP.NET Core 6
This project is a demonstration of how to implement social login functionality using ASP.NET Core 6. With this implementation, users can log in to your application using their social media accounts, such as Facebook, Google, Twitter.

The project is built using C# and the latest version of ASP.NET Core. The user interface is created using Razor views, HTML, and CSS. The project uses the ASP.NET Core Identity framework for user authentication and authorization.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to have the following installed on your machine:

.NET 6 SDK
Visual Studio Code or any other IDE of your choice.
Once you have these installed, clone the project to your machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/social-login-aspnetcore6.git
After cloning the project, open it in your IDE and run the application. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

dotnet run

This will start the application and you can access it by navigating to http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.

Usage
To use the social login functionality, click on the login button and select the social media platform you want to use for authentication. You will be redirected to the social media platform's login page where you can enter your credentials. Once authenticated, you will be redirected back to the application and will be logged in.

I might extend this project to include other features such as an online voting system.
